# Map Matrix

Compare multiple maps side by side.

**This project was mostly generated by Claude AI.**

I wanted to develop a simple tool that I needed for [veloplanner.com](https://veloplanner.com). I thought about using this opportunity to try out Claude AI for coding a project from scratch. It worked surprisingly well! I was able to explain my idea and get a working prototype in a few hours. Most of the time I was just copying code from Claude and pasting it into the editor.

You can add custom map source by clicking the "Add Custom Source" button in the navbar.
Configuration is stored in the browser's local storage.
