# Map Matrix

Compare multiple maps side by side. [Live demo](https://veloplanner.github.io/map-matrix/)

**This project was mostly generated by Claude AI.**

I wanted to develop a simple tool that I needed for [veloplanner.com](https://veloplanner.com). I thought about using this opportunity to try out Claude AI for coding a project from scratch. It worked surprisingly well! I was able to explain my idea and get a working prototype in a few hours. Most of the time I was just copying code from Claude and pasting it into the editor. Later, I started using Cursor AI (with claude-3.5-sonnet model) which improved the experience a lot. I will try adding info in the commits when AI couldn't handle task.
